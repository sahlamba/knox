      mark by its strength enhancing knacks and extreme weight reduction measures.\
      The use of aluminium parts was continued and the CVT was tuned in for maximum\
      power output. The wheel assembly and steering were customised to deliver excellent\
      vehicle handling and minimizing extreme trajectory hazards. Bruizer had the highest\
      acceleration and best ​Gradient Tracking​ till date. Had it not met with an accident\
      in the first half hour of the endurance race, the history might have taken a different\
      course, so to say. But the team mates are anything but discouraged and ready to set\
      the mark in the next competition, yet to come.'

      This year we bagged the trophy for the extensive use of CAE tools for monitoring\

       Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). This was the 3rd consecutive year \
       that we finished 1st among all the IITs in the country.'

       Blaze stood 10th among the 280 teams that participated. The position was first amongst the\
        IITs. Special emphasis was given to bring out a robust and durable design and this was\
        achieved through metal fabrication incorporating various reinforcement techniques. The\
